Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of risk factors and diagnostic results related to cervical cancer. By exploring patterns and implementing predictive models, the project aims to aid in early detection and diagnosis of cervical cancer, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Features
Data Exploration: Understand the dataset with summary statistics and visualizations.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
Machine Learning Modeling: Implement and evaluate various models to predict the likelihood of cervical cancer.
Model Evaluation: Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The analysis is based on the dataset kag_risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv, which includes information on 34 variables such as age, sexual behavior, smoking habits, contraceptive use, and results from diagnostic tests like Hinselmann, Schiller, cytology, and biopsy.

Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
